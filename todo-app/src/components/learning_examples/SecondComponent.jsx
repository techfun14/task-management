        Next, go through each part of the code provided earlier. For example, the UserList component fetches data from the API. Explain how useEffect and useState work here. Then, the AddUser component uses Formik and Yup for form handling and validation. Break down the form submission process and how it connects to the backend.
      For the next steps, outline converting basic HTML elements to Material-UI components, adding routing, form validation, edit functionality, and error handling. Each step should be a logical progression from the previous one, ensuring the user can follow along without getting lost.
      Also, anticipate possible confusion points. For instance, the difference between JSX and HTML, why using Material-UI components instead of plain HTML, how state management works in React, and how API calls are made using Axios. Provide examples for each concept to make it clearer.
